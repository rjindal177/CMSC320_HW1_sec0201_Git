Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: If one prefers a clean, linear history free of unnecessary merge commits, 
one should reach for git rebase instead of git merge when integrating changes from 
another branch.
On the other hand, if you want to preserve the complete history of your project and 
avoid the risk of re-writing public commits, you can stick with git merge.
